        <h4>Droncar Hill Walks</h4>
        <h5>
          Droncar has an easy access route from the picnic site that’s firm and level, with no obstacles. If you’re looking for something more energetic, follow the burn further up the valley or find the remains of Droncar Tower and an Iron Age hill fort.
          Muirdac is a hidden gem, a quiet forest close to Peebles with some charming trails through open woodland. It can be particularly good early in the morning, when mist hangs in the valley below.
          Enjoy a picnic and a stroll at Leethorn: the meadows here are important for butterflies, and we manage the land so the conditions are just right for them.

        <h4>Muirdac Hill Walks</h4>
        <h5>
          Muirdac Hill gives commanding views over Peebles and Tressforest Forest. The scenery is at its best on misty mornings or in the low light of early evening.
          It’s an ideal place for wildlife spotting. Keep an eye – and an ear – open for small birds such as siskins, warblers and crossbills, or greater spotted woodpeckers. If you’re very lucky you’ll catch a glimpse of tawny owls fleeting through the trees at dusk or red deer bouncing through the trees.
